# Data-analysis-algorithm
# 1. Linear regression algorithm. Gradient descent
Tasks to be solved: Select the learning rate (alpha) and the number of iterations; Instead of setting the number of iterations, set the condition for stopping the algorithm when the error per iteration begins to change below a certain threshold â€” a simplified analogue of the tol parameter in linear regression in sklearn.
# 2. Scaling of features. L1- and L2-regularization. Stochastic gradient descent
Tasks to be solved: Plot the dependence of the weights of all features on lambda in L2-regularization based on the data from the lesson; Is it possible to apply both normalization and standardization to the same feature at once?; Write a function like eval_model_reg2, but for the application of L1-regularization.
