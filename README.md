# Linear regression algorithm. Gradient descent
Tasks to be solved: Select the learning rate (alpha) and the number of iterations; Instead of setting the number of iterations, set the condition for stopping the algorithm when the error per iteration begins to change below a certain threshold â€” a simplified analogue of the tol parameter in linear regression in sklearn.
